## About

E-commerce website allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Itâ€™s tough to imagine daily life without e-commerce. We order food, clothes, and furniture; we register for classes and other online services; we download books, music, and movies; and so much more. E-commerce has taken root and is here to stay.

In winter semester 21/22 for the cource of Advance Software Engeneering offered and taught by "Prof. Dr. Stefan Edlich". I am developing this simple E-commerce website with the basic functionalities, I have found this cource very informative and I have learned a lot during the developmemt of this project. I hope this project will help many others as it have helped me.

SonarCloud is a cloud service offered by SonarSource and based on SonarQube. SonarQube is a widely adopted open source platform to inspect continuously the quality of source code and detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in more than 20 different languages.

## 3) Build Management (Semaphore) ![68747470733a2f2f6368616e64726176616d7368692e73656d6170686f726563692e636f6d2f6261646765732f65636f6d6d657263652f6272616e636865732f6d61737465722e737667](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52135942/151913497-b29b588d-cfda-4b26-8d6f-74783fa89d6f.svg)

I used semaphore which is very easy and simple to understand.
In semaphore build I did
* (installing dependencies) where all the dependencies related to application are installed.
* (code analysis) it runs the PHP Copy Paste Detector from online repository.
* (unit test) runs the unit tests from the phpunit binary in vendor folder.
* (browser test) Here it runs the browser test by openeing the application in browser and checks the response.
* (security check) ensioLabs security checker, will scan the project dependencies which are  known for vulnerabilities.

## 4) Clean code development
* used only crud operations.
* to make it work on live server change credentials in db.php
* custom made, no framework used


## 5) IDE
PhpStorm is Usd as IDE in this Project it is a PHP IDE. It provides on-the-fly error prevention, autocompletion and code refactoring, zero configuration debugging and an extended HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editor. PhpStorm also provides powerful built-in tools for debugging, testing and profiling your applications.

* Intelligent coding assistance
* Smart PHP Code Editor
* Code Quality Analysis
* Debugging, Testing and Profiling
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript Editor
* JavaScript Editor 
* Development Environment 
* Databases & SQL

## 6) DSL

## 7) Functional Programming

 I used only create, read, update, delete functions which are very actual things in any application.
 
 * In that we have normal functions
 * functions with parameters.
 * side effect free function.
 * high order functions
