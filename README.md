[![Sonarcloud Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=com.lapots.breed.judge:judge-rule-engine&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=YaqoobD_david-ecommerce)

SonarCloud is a cloud service offered by SonarSource and based on SonarQube. SonarQube is a widely adopted open source platform to inspect continuously the quality of source code and detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in more than 20 different languages.

# 3) Clean code development
* To generate files I used command line commands which will create files with all functions.
     * for eg: ```php artisan make:model``` ProductsModel  this command will generate model file for products
* I only created once for storing images that code can be used anywhere in the application to store images. This is called traits in laravel.
* I also created flash messages traits which can used when a using create, update, delete etc..,
* Laravel uses mvc architecture so there is clean flow from routes - controllers - models - views.
* used only crud operations .
